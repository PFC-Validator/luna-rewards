The following is the calculation method for determining who will win 10 Luna every week on the PFC Validator.

The rules are:

- Minimum Stake of 1 Luna
- Maximum Stake of 10K Luna

While the selection criteria is subject to change, the random number generator is seeded from the hash of the delegation file, so is reproducable.
